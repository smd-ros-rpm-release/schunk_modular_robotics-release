%description
This package provides simulated tactile sensors for the Schunk Dextrous Hand
(SDH) which is mounted on the Care-O-bot arm. The node subscribes to the Gazebo
bumper topics of the SDH. It transforms the Gazebo feedback to the
&quot;tactile_data&quot; topic to provide the same tactile sensor interface as
the schunk_sdh package. The following parameters can be set: * cells_x: The
number of patches on the tactile sensor in the direction perpendicular to the
finger. Defaults to 6. * cells_y: The number of patches on the tactile sensor
along the direction of the finger. Defaults to 14. * output_range: The maximum
output value of one patch. Defaults to 3500. * sensitivity: The change of output
in one patch per Newton. Defaults to 350. The sensitivity can be approximated by
the following formula: S = output_range / (measurement_range * cell_area) - The
measurement range of the tactile pads is 250 kPa (from the data sheet). - The
output range can be determined by experiment from the real SDH. It is about
3500. - The cell area is the size of one patch. Length and width of the area are
determined by dividing the length/width of the collision surface by the number
of cells in the respective direction. Important: In most cases this is NOT the
cell area that is given in the data sheet! * filter_length: The length of the
moving average filter which smoothes the values from simulation. Defaults to 10.
The node subscribes to the following topics to receive data from the simulation:
* thumb_2/state * thumb_3/state * finger_12/state * finger_13/state *
finger_22/state * finger_23/state The node publishes the processed data on the
following topic: * tactile_data The simulated bumper must obtain the collision
data in the link that the sensor is attached to. This is achieved by setting the
&quot;frameName&quot; property in the gazebo_ros_bumper controller.
